# Introduction

The following report is composed by two parts. The first one generate a
distribution of the means and variances of an exponential distribution,
compare the estimated parameters with the theoretical ones and plot the
resulting distributions.

The second part is a series of significance test of the ToothGrowth
database, testing differences between treatment and doses.

# Part 1: Simulations

## 1.1 - Generate data

The first step is to generate the simulations data, here I've used the
rexp() function to generate 1000 samples of 40 observations, with lambda
= 0.2. Then get the mean and variance of every individual sample and
store them the "avg" and "var" variables respectively.

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide', message=FALSE}
#First we load the relevant packages
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#generate the distributions and get the estimated values of the parameters
avg <- numeric()
var <- numeric()
for(i in 1:1000){
dist_exp <- rexp(40, 0.2)
avg[i] <- mean(dist_exp)
var[i] <- var(dist_exp)
}
Estimadores <- as_tibble(cbind(avg, var))
```

## 1.2 - Plotting the results

Once generated the estimated parameters of the mean and variance of the
distribution I've used ggplot to create an histogram and look at the
form of the distribution. The resulting plots are presented in the
following figures, when we can observe that the distribution of the
means resembles a normal distribution, on the other hand, the
distribution of the variance resembles more a poisson distribution.

In both cases the sample average of the parameters (mean of
`r mean(avg)` and variance of `r mean(var)`), showed by the red lines,
are close to the theoretical parameters, represented by the green line. **(Results showed in appendix 1)**


# Part 2: Statistical inference

## 2.1 - Understanding the database

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='hide', warning=FALSE}
#loading packages and the database
library(datasets)
library(stargazer)

toothgrowth <- datasets::ToothGrowth
```

The database for the project is the ToothGrowth database, that measure
the growth of 60 guinea pigs tooth, treated by two types of supplements,
orange juice (OJ) and a form of vitamin C called ascorbic acid (VC). The
treatments are supplemented in doses of 0.5, 1 and 2 mg/day. The
database contains the following variables:

1.-len(num) = indicates the length of the tooths at the end of the treatment

2.-supp(factor) = indicates the treatment method

3.-dose(num) = indicates the doses in mg/day

## 2.2 - Summary of the data

```{r, echo=FALSE}
summary(toothgrowth) 
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis',dev='pdf'}
stargazer(toothgrowth,title = "Summary Statistics", header = F)
```

**(Distribution of results showed in appendix 2)**

## 2.3 - Statistical test

### Test 1: Is there a difference between treatment methods?

H0: mean(OJ) = mean(VC)

```{r, echo=FALSE}
oj <- filter(toothgrowth, supp=="OJ")
vc <- filter(toothgrowth, supp=="VC")

pval_test1 <- t.test(oj$len, vc$len, paired = F, alternative = "two.sided", conf.level = 0.975)$p.value

confint_test1 <- t.test(oj$len, vc$len, paired = F, alternative = "two.sided", conf.level = 0.975)$conf.int

```

Conclusion: Confidence interval with 95% confidence is equal to
`r confint_test1` and includes zero, therefore we fail to reject H0 and
there is no evidence that the treatment affect differently on the
toothgrowth for guinea pigs. Also P-value is equal to `r pval_test1`,
and we fail to reject the null hypothesis under 95% confidence.

### Test 2: Is there a difference between doses?

H0a: mean(0.5) = mean(1)

H0b: mean(1) = mean(2)

H0b: mean(0.5) = mean(2)

```{r, echo=FALSE}
mg0.5 <- filter(toothgrowth, dose==0.5)
mg1 <- filter(toothgrowth, dose==1)
mg2 <- filter(toothgrowth, dose==2)
pval2.1 <- t.test(mg0.5$len, mg1$len, paired=F, alternative = "two.sided", conf.level = 0.975)$p.value

pval2.2 <- t.test(mg2$len, mg1$len, paired=F, alternative = "two.sided", conf.level = 0.975)$p.value

pval2.3 <- t.test(mg2$len, mg0.5$len, paired=F, alternative = "two.sided", conf.level = 0.975)$p.value
```

a) dif 0.5 mg/day and 1 mg/day

With a P-value of `r pval2.1` we reject the H0 and conclude that there
is significant difference between 0.5 and 1 mg per day at any reasonable
significance level.

b) dif 1 mg/day and 2 mg/day

With a P-value of `r pval2.2` we reject the H0 and conclude that there
is significant difference between 1 and 2 mg per day at any reasonable
significance level.

c) dif 0.5 mg/day and 2 mg/day

With a P-value of `r pval2.3` we reject the H0 and conclude that there
is significant difference between 0.5 and 2 mg per day at any reasonable
significance level.

### test 3: What treatment-doses pairs are signiticantly different?

For this test, as it's being tested 9 hypothesis, I've applied a
**Bonferroni correction** as the criteria to find the significant
differences. This has been done saving the p-values in the pValues
variable and applied the p.adjust function to get the p-values adjusted
by the Bonferroni correction.

Also, since the samples have only 10 observations in every table, a
**bootstrap** method is used to generate 1000 iterations of the means of
resamples values, with repetitions, to be able to draw better
conclusions from the data.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#generating the databases and appling bootstrap
n <- 10 # all tables have 10 values, so this is the "n" values for all of them 
B <- 1000 # 1000 bootstrap itarations

oj0.5 <- filter(toothgrowth, dose==0.5, supp == "OJ")
rs_oj05 <- matrix(sample(oj0.5$len,n*B, replace = T),B,n) #resampled data
rsMoj05 <- apply(rs_oj05, 1, mean) #resampled Means


oj1 <- filter(toothgrowth, dose==1, supp == "OJ")
rs_oj1 <- matrix(sample(oj1$len,n*B, replace = T),B,n) #resampled data
rsMoj1 <- apply(rs_oj1, 1, mean) #resampled Means

oj2 <- filter(toothgrowth, dose==2, supp == "OJ")
rs_oj2 <- matrix(sample(oj2$len,n*B, replace = T),B,n) #resampled data
rsMoj2 <- apply(rs_oj2, 1, mean) #resampled Means


vc0.5 <- filter(toothgrowth, dose==0.5, supp == "VC")
rs_vc05 <- matrix(sample(vc0.5$len,n*B, replace = T),B,n) #resampled data
rsMvc05 <- apply(rs_vc05, 1, mean) #resampled Means

vc1 <- filter(toothgrowth, dose==1, supp == "VC")
rs_vc1 <- matrix(sample(vc1$len,n*B, replace = T),B,n) #resampled data
rsMvc1 <- apply(rs_vc1, 1, mean) #resampled Means

vc2 <- filter(toothgrowth, dose==2, supp == "VC")
rs_vc2 <- matrix(sample(vc2$len,n*B, replace = T),B,n) #resampled data
rsMvc2 <- apply(rs_vc2, 1, mean) #resampled Means

```

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#p-values with the same doses and different treatment method

pValues <- matrix(nrow = 9, ncol = 2)

pValues[1,] <- c(t.test(rsMoj05, rsMvc05, paired=F, alternative = "two.sided", conf.level = 0.975)$p.value,"OJ-VC, 0.5mg/day")
pValues[2,] <- c(t.test(rsMoj1, rsMvc1, paired=F, alternative = "two.sided", conf.level = 0.975)$p.value,"OJ-VC, 1mg/day")
pValues[3,] <- c(t.test(rsMoj2, rsMvc2, paired=F, alternative = "two.sided", conf.level = 0.975)$p.value,"OJ-VC, 2mg/day")

#p-values for difference betwen same treatment method and different doses 
pValues[4,] <- c(t.test(rsMoj05, rsMoj1, paired=F, alternative = "two.sided", conf.level = 0.975)$p.value,"OJ, 0.5-1 mg/day")
pValues[5,] <- c(t.test(rsMoj05, rsMoj2, paired=F, alternative = "two.sided", conf.level = 0.975)$p.value,"OJ, 0.5-2 mg/day")
pValues[6,] <- c(t.test(oj2$len, rsMoj1, paired=F, alternative = "two.sided", conf.level = 0.975)$p.value,"OJ,2-1 mg/day")
pValues[7,] <- c(t.test(rsMvc05, rsMvc1, paired=F, alternative = "two.sided", conf.level = 0.975)$p.value,"VC, 0.5-1 mg/day")
pValues[8,] <- c(t.test(rsMvc05, rsMvc2, paired=F, alternative = "two.sided", conf.level = 0.975)$p.value,"VC, 0.5-2 mg/day")
pValues[9,] <- c(t.test(rsMvc2, rsMvc1, paired=F, alternative = "two.sided", conf.level = 0.975)$p.value,"VC, 2-1 mg/day")

pValues <- as_tibble(pValues)
pValues <- mutate(pValues, adj_values = p.adjust(pValues$V1, method = "bonferroni"))
Sig_5_percent <- sapply(pValues$adj_values, function(x) {if(x<0.05){"Yes"}else{"No"}})
pValues <- cbind(pValues, Sig_5_percent)

```

Conclusions: The following results have a significant difference

```{r,results='markup', echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
filter(pValues,Sig_5_percent=="Yes") %>% 
    select(V2, adj_values) %>% 
    rename(Pair_treatment_dose=V2) %>% 
    kableExtra::kable(format = "latex", booktabs=T) %>% 
    kableExtra::add_header_above(header = "Significant test at 5% with bonferroni correction")

```

```{r}
